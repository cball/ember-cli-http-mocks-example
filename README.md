# HTTP Mock Example

This is a quick example of a freshly generated ember-cli app with a few HTTP mocks in
place.

No promises it will run on < `0.0.44`. If you're using slightly earlier versions, the `server/index.js` file might look a bit different.

If you're using <= `0.0.40` things will look different, and the blueprint _(what is run when you do ember generate)_ will be called `api-stub` instead of `http-mock`.
